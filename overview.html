<p>The <b>Economics of Nature-Based Adaptation (ENBA)</b> app allows you to explore current and future risks from coastal hazards and compare the cost-effectiveness of nature-based adaptation (green) to a coastal armoring strategy (gray) across coastal Ventura County.
</p>
<p>
Results suggest that nature-based adaptation approaches are as effective in reducing damages as coastal armoring approaches.
</p>
<p>
The costs for both management scenarios are about the same $1B, with nature-based adaptation slightly lower the coastal armoring.
</p>
<p>
Decision-makers can explore which alternatives perform the best across a variety of assumptions and results can be explored using different assumptions about: the frequency of storm evens/coastal hazards/SLR; the discount rate  used; and, the monetary value of ecosystem services. See pages 64-66, 68 & 69 of the report.
</p>
<p>
The key steps in this approach which you can explore in the differnt Tabs of the app are:
<ul class="b">
<li><b>Exposure:</b> to explore different inundation scenarios; </li>
<li><b>Risk:</b> to explore different hazards, discount rates, storm frequencys, and geographies (municipality, city or other unit); </li>
<li><b>Solutions:</b> to compare management scenarios (green/gray), discount rate, value of ecosystem services (i.e. value of wetland) = cost benefit curve of two management scenarios . </li>
</ul>
